STLs and documentation for my Frosthaven organization system. [thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6462347/)

## overview
Inspired by the [Folded Space Map Tile Organizer](https://www.foldedspace.net/store/frosthaven-map-archive/), but not wishing to actually purchase the product, I set out to design my own [Frosthaven](https://cephalofair.com/collections/board-games/products/frosthaven-bundles) organization system. What started as a 3D printing experiment led to a big old rabbit hole of placement, rendering, material optimization, and [why oh why does ABS never stick properly](https://www.reddit.com/r/3Dprinting/comments/cza9o3/comment/eyx3e02/)! Needless to say I learned a lot about 3D printing, mechanical design, Fusion 360 workflows, and [blobs of death](https://www.reddit.com/r/prusa3d/comments/rh05cy/how_the_hell_do_i_avoid_the_blob_of_death/). Anyways, now I'm done, and you may view my work.

NB this organization system assumes you are using the (most excellent) [xHaven assistant app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/x-haven-assistant/id1639494414) to track monster actions. My status tokens and monster stat cards sit comfortably in their original wrapping as my busy crew and I save about an hour of work. We also don't use the player wheels but you could toss those in here relatively easily. Remaining utility items (standee holders, loot/chest tokens, damage/number/letter tokens) sit loosely in their own bags as they are used every time anyways.

## assembly
Much of this box bulge comes from prior implementations of this build system. Map tile 12 in particular likes to rest a touch wider than the box and its corners may fray as a result. Use a tape guard to protect these corners.

A lot of this box organization can be rearranged to your liking. I've had the books at the edge of the box as well, mixed around player and tile boxes, etc.

### Map Tile Holder
Print 6 of these. Use a label maker to identify which tiles go where. I've found the following division to work quite well.

### Monster Holders
Note that the inserts are printed *mirrored* such that opening the box as below results in a direct visual mapping. There is a small errata here - the small monster box only fits Abael Herders 1-4. Place 5-6 in the overflow box (along with the water tiles). If you actually ever end up needing them, well, sorry?

### Card Holders
I cut up a bunch of [index card sorters](https://www.amazon.com/OFFILICIOUS-Manila-Index-Card-Dividers/dp/B0C9PXV3JC/) to serve as dividers for both small and large card sorters. I haven't completed the game so I can't guarantee these will accommodate any cards yet unrevealed. But it does accommodate everything from the base set as well as envelope B so far.

I was desperately trying to get these to print in ABS and kept getting unresolvable warp issues. ABS slurry ruined my first PEI sheet and neither glue stick nor design modifications were sufficient to get good global adhesion. I've left the various design artifacts I tried in these models because screw it, I'm done.

### Tile Overlay Holders

#### Hex
All 1-hex and 2-hex tiles go here. The lid is oriented with the dividers in the box.

#### Fab
Constructed obstacles (e.g. altars, bookcases) go here. Doors also go in this one.

#### Trap
All hazardous / difficult terrain go here. 1-hex obstacle rubble goes here as well.

#### Misc
The remaining 2-hex tiles, ice/snow stuff, all go in here.
![misc tile box](./images/misc_tile_box.jpg)
#### Overflow / Boss
The overflow side is for water tiles and all other 3-hex tiles. The Boss side is for bosses (and those extra couple Abael Herders).

### Player Boxes
Print 4 of these. While I haven't yet unlocked all classes, so far these boxes have accommodated fully sleeved player decks, mod decks, minifigs, and summon tokens for Boneshaper and Banner Spear. The character sheet and information tile act as a fitted lid to the box.

### Minifig Tray
Just a simple tray to keep the minifig boxes together while stuff goes in and out of the box.
