# frostbuild
STLs and documentation for my Frosthaven organization system.

## overview
Inspired by the [Folded Space Map Tile Organizer](https://www.foldedspace.net/store/frosthaven-map-archive/), but not wishing to actually purchase the product, I set out to design my own [Frosthaven](https://cephalofair.com/collections/board-games/products/frosthaven-bundles) organization system. What started as a 3D printing experiment led to a big old rabbit hole of placement, rendering, material optimization, and [why oh why does ABS never stick properly](https://www.reddit.com/r/3Dprinting/comments/cza9o3/comment/eyx3e02/)! Needless to say I learned a lot about 3D printing, mechanical design, Fusion 360 workflows, and [blobs of death](https://www.reddit.com/r/prusa3d/comments/rh05cy/how_the_hell_do_i_avoid_the_blob_of_death/). Anyways, now I'm done, and you may view my work.

## contents

### Map Tile Holder
Print 6 of these. Use a label maker to identify which tiles go where. I've found the following division to work quite well.
- 01-02
- 03-05
- 06-08
- 09-11
- 12-13
- 14-16

### Monster Holders
There is a small errata here - the small monster box only fits Abael Herders 1-4. Place 5-6 in the overflow box (along wiht the water tiles). If you actually ever end up needing them, well, don't actually waste your time telling me.

[TODO] provide lid inserts with what goes where
- Small Monster Box
- Large Monster Box

### Card Holders
I cut up a bunch of [index card sorters](https://www.amazon.com/OFFILICIOUS-Manila-Index-Card-Dividers/dp/B0C9PXV3JC/) to serve as dividers for both small and large card sorters. I haven't completed the game so I can't guarantee these will accommodate any cards yet unrevealed. But it does accommodate everything from the base set as well as envelope B so far.

I was desperately trying to get these to print in ABS and kept getting unresolvable warp issues. ABS slurry ruined my first PEI sheet and neither glue stick nor design modifications were sufficient to get good global adhesion. I've left the various design artifacts I tried in these models because screw it, I'm done.
- Small Card Holder
- Large Card Holder

### Tile Overlay Holders
[TODO] provide photos
- Hex: All 1-hex and 2-hex tiles go here. The lid is oriented with the dividers in the box.
- Fab: Constructed obstacles (e.g. altars, bookcases) go here. Doors also go in this one.
- Trap: All hazardous / difficult terrain go here. 1-hex obstacle rubble goes here as well.
- Misc: The remaining 2-hex tiles, ice/snow stuff, all go in here.
- Overflow / Boss: The overflow side is for water tiles and all other 3-hex tiles. The Boss side is for bosses.
  
### Player Boxes
Print 4 of these. While I haven't yet unlocked all classes, so far these boxes have accommodated fully sleeved player decks, mod decks, minifigs, and summon tokens for Boneshaper and Banner Spear.

### Minifig Tray
Just a simple tray to keep the minifig boxes together while stuff goes in and out of the box.
